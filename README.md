Obesity Dataset with k-Nearest Neighbors
Context
Welcome to the Scaler Healthcare data analysis team! As part of our ongoing efforts to understand and combat obesity globally, we're leveraging data to gain insights into factors contributing to obesity. You've been tasked with analyzing the Obesity Dataset, applying the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to predict obesity levels based on individuals' eating habits and physical conditions.

Dataset Description
The dataset you'll be working with contains attributes related to individuals' eating habits and physical conditions. Here's a breakdown of the features you'll encounter:

Eating Habits Attributes:
FAVC (Frequent consumption of high caloric food): Indicates if the individual frequently eats high caloric food.
FCVC (Frequency of consumption of vegetables): Reflects how often the individual consumes vegetables.
NCP (Number of main meals): Represents the number of main meals the individual has in a day.
CAEC (Consumption of food between meals): Shows how frequently the individual eats between meals.
CH20 (Consumption of water daily): Details the daily water consumption.
CALC (Consumption of alcohol): Provides information on the individual's alcohol consumption.
Physical Condition Attributes:
SCC (Calories consumption monitoring): Indicates if the individual monitors their calorie intake.
FAF (Physical activity frequency): Reflects the frequency of physical activity.
TUE (Time using technology devices): Denotes the time spent using technology devices.
MTRANS (Transportation used): Details the primary mode of transportation.
